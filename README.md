# CodeImager

CodeImager is a simple tool to convert a plain text file into an image file.

I use it to turn programs I have written into images so that students cannot just copy and paste my code, and instead have to type it in.

## Usage

To run from the command line:

`python imager.py <textfile> <imagefile>`
